        'The Palace of the Raïs, also known as Bastion 23, comprises an architectural ensemble consisting of three palaces numbered 17, 18, and 23, along with six fishermen\'s houses numbered 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 15. All these structures date back to the Ottoman era, constructed between the 16th and 18th centuries.This monumental complex holds particular significance in Algiers, serving not only as architectural examples from the Ottoman period but also as one of the few remaining physical witnesses to the extension of the Casbah of Algiers towards the sea until the 19th century.',

    title: 'History',
    description:
        'The history of the palace traces its origins to the establishment of Bordj-Ez-zoubia in 1576 under the supervision of Dey Ramdan Pacha. This construction aimed to fortify the defensive infrastructure of the lower medina. Initially known by various names such as Quaâ-Essour (base of the rampart), Sebâa tbaren (the seven taverns), and Topanet Arnaout, the latter due to the artillery installations by corsair Mami Arnaout. The designation Bastion 23 was later applied during the era of French colonization concurrent with the construction of ramparts. Conversely, the numerical labels for palaces (Palace 16, Palace 17, etc.) and the homes of the \'fishermen\' stem from cadastral assignments dating back to the same period.The lone historical reference available pertains to Palace 18, erected around 1750 under the supervision of the corsair Mami Arnaout.',
